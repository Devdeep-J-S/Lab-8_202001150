## Unit Testing with JUnit

Goal: 
> The goal of this lab is to learn how to use JUnit to write unit tests for Java programs.

# Preliminary – Learn about JUnit in Eclipse:
> The primary goal of unit testing is to take the smallest piece of testable software in an application, isolate it from the remainder of the code, and determine whether or not it behaves the way you expect it to behave. Each unit is tested separately before integrating it into the rest of the program. In other words, classes should be tested in isolation from other classes (test the methods of a class before you use the class elsewhere). Unit testing has proven its value in that a large percentage of defects are identified during unit testing.

> 1. Create a new Eclipse project, and within the project create a package and 2. Create a class for a Boa. Here’s the code you can use (you may copy/paste):

Initial Boa.java code : 
```java 
package lab8_test;

//represents a boa constructor
public class Boa {
    private String name;
    private int length; // the length of the boa, in feet
    private String favoriteFood;
    public Boa(String name, int length, String favoriteFood) {
        this.name = name;
        this.length = length;
        this.favoriteFood = favoriteFood;
    }
    //returns true if this boa constructor is healthy
    public boolean isHealthy() {
        return this.favoriteFood.equals("granola bars");
    }
    //returns true if the length of this boa constructor is
    //less than the given cage length
    public boolean fitsInCage(int cageLength) {
        return this.length < cageLength;
    }
}
```

> 3. Follow the instructions in the JUnit tutorial in the section “Creating a JUnit Test Case in Eclipse”. You’ll be creating a test case for the class Boa. When you’re asked to select test method stubs, select both isHealthy() and fitsInCage(int). <br>
> 4. Now it’s time to write some unit tests. Notice that the BoaTest class that JUnit created for you contains stubs for several methods. The first stub (for the method setUp()) is annotated with @Before. The @Before annotation denotes that the method setUp() will be run prior to the execution of each test method. setUp() is typically used to initialize data needed by each test. Modify the setUp() method so that it creates a couple of Boa objects, as follows:
```java
@Before
public void setUp() throws Exception {
jen = new Boa("Jennifer", 2, "grapes");
ken = new Boa ("Kenneth", 3, "granola bars");
}
```
> Note : (You will need to add private fields for jen and ben to the BoaTest class, otherwise the compiler will complain that there are no variables with those names.)

> 5. JUnit also provided stubs for two test methods, each annotated with @Test. Work on
the testIsHealthy() method first. The purpose of this method is to check that the
isHealthy() method in the Boa class behaves the way it’s supposed to. In the JUnit
tutorial, read the section on “Writing Tests”. Modify the testIsHealthy() method so that
it checks the results of activating the isHealthy() method on the two Boa objects you
created in setup().

> Likewise, modify the testFitsInCage() method to test the results of that method. Make
sure your test is robust; it should check the results when the cage length is less than the
length of the boa, when the cage length is equal to the length of the boa, and when the
cage length is greater than the length of the boa.
> Should you write tests for both jen and ken? 

Ans: Yes, because their lengths are different so we can get more insight for code by making test for both of them.

> Now you can run your tests. Read the section “Running Your Test Case” in the tutorial.
Did you get a green bar in the JUnit pane? If you got a red bar, use the output in the
JUnit pane to determine which test(s) failed. Fix your tests, and try running the test
case again.
It’s important to note that a red bar doesn’t necessarily mean that the test case is
written incorrectly; it could be that the method that’s being tested isn’t correct. In fact,
that’s what unit testing is supposed to do – help us find errors in our code. When a test

fails, you need to determine if the error is in the test case itself or in the code it’s
testing.

> 7. Add a new method to the Boa class, with this purpose and signature:

```java
// produces the length of the Boa in inches
public int lengthInInches(){
// you need to write the body of this method
}
```

> Add a new test case to the BoaTest class that tests the lengthInInches() method. Make sure you annotate the new test method with @Test. Run your tests.

Boa.java 
```java
package lab8_test;

//represents a boa constructor
public class Boa {
    private String name;
    private int length; // the length of the boa, in feet
    private String favoriteFood;
    public Boa(String name, int length, String favoriteFood) {
        this.name = name;
        this.length = length;
        this.favoriteFood = favoriteFood;
    }
    //returns true if this boa constructor is healthy
    public boolean isHealthy() {
        return this.favoriteFood.equals("granola bars");
    }
    //returns true if the length of this boa constructor is
    //less than the given cage length
    public boolean fitsInCage(int cageLength) {
        return this.length < cageLength;
    }
    
 // produces the length of the Boa in inches
    public int lengthInInches(){
    // you need to write the body of this method
    	//assuming original length is in feet 
    	// 1 feet = 12 inch 
    	return this.length*12 ; 
    }
}
```

BoaTest.java
```java
package lab8_test;

import static org.junit.Assert.*;

import org.junit.After;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;

public class BoaTest {

	static Boa Mitsuha , Taki;  // Your name .
	@Before
	public void setUp() throws Exception {
			Mitsuha = new Boa("Mitsuha",5,"granola bars") ;
			Taki = new Boa("Taki",6,"Ramen");
		}

	@Test
	public void testIsHealthy() {
		assertTrue(Mitsuha.isHealthy());
		assertFalse(Taki.isHealthy());
	}
	
	@Test
	public void testFitsInCage()
	{
		assertTrue(Mitsuha.fitsInCage(6));
		assertFalse(Taki.fitsInCage(6));
	}
	
	@Test 
	public void testlengthInInches(){
		int len = Mitsuha.lengthInInches() ; 
		assertEquals(60,len);
	}
	
	@After
	public void last_func()
	{
		Mitsuha =null ;
		Taki = null ; 
		System.out.println("Thank you for this lab!!!");
	}

}
```
