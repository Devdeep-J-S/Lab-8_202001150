## Unit Testing with JUnit

Goal: 
> The goal of this lab is to learn how to use JUnit to write unit tests for Java programs.

# Preliminary – Learn about JUnit in Eclipse:
> The primary goal of unit testing is to take the smallest piece of testable software in an application, isolate it from the remainder of the code, and determine whether or not it behaves the way you expect it to behave. Each unit is tested separately before integrating it into the rest of the program. In other words, classes should be tested in isolation from other classes (test the methods of a class before you use the class elsewhere). Unit testing has proven its value in that a large percentage of defects are identified during unit testing.

> 1. Create a new Eclipse project, and within the project create a package and 2. Create a class for a Boa. Here’s the code you can use (you may copy/paste):

Initial Boa.java code : 
```java 
package lab8_test;

//represents a boa constructor
public class Boa {
    private String name;
    private int length; // the length of the boa, in feet
    private String favoriteFood;
    public Boa(String name, int length, String favoriteFood) {
        this.name = name;
        this.length = length;
        this.favoriteFood = favoriteFood;
    }
    //returns true if this boa constructor is healthy
    public boolean isHealthy() {
        return this.favoriteFood.equals("granola bars");
    }
    //returns true if the length of this boa constructor is
    //less than the given cage length
    public boolean fitsInCage(int cageLength) {
        return this.length < cageLength;
    }
}
```
